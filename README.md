# Audiobook-Maker
This is to make .pdf, .doc, .docx, and .txt files to audiobook<br />
It is need of some testing and debugging<br />

I would also like it if you can contribute to include other file extensions that you think are useful, such as epub <br />
Its efficiency can be improved a lot, but I do not have the required knowledge for it <br />

The text-to-speech-stable file can only do pdf files of a directory, but has no bugs.<br />

Enjoy!
